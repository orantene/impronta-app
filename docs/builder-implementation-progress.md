# Tulala builder — implementation progress tracker

This file is the source of truth for the autonomous implementation of the
builder per `docs/mockups/builder-experience.html` (26-surface design spec).

A scheduled task fires every 3 hours during waking hours, reads this file,
picks the next unchecked item, builds it, commits + pushes, checks the box,
and stops. The next fire continues. No human approval required between
items — the user has authorised end-to-end execution.

---

## Live state

- **Active milestone:** D — "Velocity"
- **Active phase:** Phase 12 schema + UX shipped — scheduled-publish drawer, server actions, migration, command-palette row, Escape chain. Cron sweep route deferred (capability bridge needed). Phase 11 (Comments) deferred to dedicated session — charter at `docs/charters/phase-11-comments.md`.
- **Last commit on phase-1 branch:** eae3711 — `feat(edit-chrome): Phase 12 — scheduled publish (schema + drawer)`. Migration + drawer + actions + topbar wiring + palette row + Escape chain. Preceded by 67b0c2d (admin aesthetic Path A: gold accents neutralised, inquiries spacing tightened, nav sub-labels).
- **Next action:** (1) Cron sweep route `/api/cron/publish-scheduled` with capability bridge — small follow-up, see `docs/qa/phase-12/README.md`. (2) Phase 11 Comments — see `docs/charters/phase-11-comments.md`. (3) Visual screenshot pass across phases 3-10 + 12 (requires staff-authenticated session).

---

## Operating rules (enforce on every fire)

1. **Read this file first.** It's the only state source.
2. **Pick the next unchecked item.** Don't skip ahead.
3. **Reference the mockup spec.** Open `docs/mockups/builder-experience.html` and copy the visual treatment exactly — same tokens, same spacing, same shadows.
4. **Quality gate before every commit:**
   - `cd web && node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` must pass with zero errors
   - Run any relevant tests (`npx playwright test path/to/test` if applicable)
   - Visual sanity-check the change if a UI surface (read the file, confirm classes match KIT tokens)
5. **One commit per logical chunk.** Don't commit the whole phase at once unless it's truly atomic.
6. **Update this file.** After each commit, check the relevant box and update "Last commit" + "Next action."
7. **Commit this file too.** Same commit or a follow-up — never let progress drift from code.
8. **Push every commit:** `git push origin phase-1`.
9. **Never skip git hooks** (no `--no-verify`).
10. **Stop when stuck.** If something genuinely needs human input (auth, secret, a real product question), write the question into "Live state" → "Next action" and stop. The user will resolve and the next fire will continue.

## Milestone A — Premium look, same features (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

### Phase 1 — Design system primitives + visual cleanup

**Goal:** every drawer uses one chrome, every input has a premium treatment, no debug labels visible. Matches mockup surfaces 1–10.

#### Kit primitives — `web/src/components/edit-chrome/kit/`
- [x] `drawer.tsx` — `Drawer`, `DrawerHead`, `DrawerBody`, `DrawerFoot`, `DrawerTabs`, `DrawerTools` (the three-button expand/fullscreen/close cluster)
- [x] `card.tsx` — `Card`, `CardHead`, `CardBody`, `CardAction`
- [x] `field.tsx` — `Field`, `FieldLabel`, `Helper`, `HelperCounter`
- [x] `stepper.tsx` — numeric stepper with unit
- [x] `segmented.tsx` — segmented control (used everywhere)
- [x] `toggle.tsx` — iOS-style switch
- [x] `swatch.tsx` — color swatch + hex input row
- [x] `pill-tabs.tsx` — folded into `drawer.tsx` (DrawerTabs / DrawerTab) — same component
- [x] `savechip.tsx` — savechip with state variants (Saved / Saving / Unsaved / counts)
- [x] `kbd.tsx` — keyboard key styling
- [x] `index.ts` — barrel export

#### Section-type icons
- [x] `section-type-icon.tsx` — re-create from the wave-3 stash with `JSX.Element → ReactElement` fix; wire all 12 type keys

#### Selection layer upgrade
- [x] Dual-tone ring (white inset 1px + ink outset 2px + halo 6px) — works on dark and light backgrounds
- [x] Premium chip — 34px height, 10px radius, gradient bg, grip dots + section icon + name + type div + toolbar
- [x] Drop indicator — blue gradient line with end-cap dots and glow (visible on dark bg)
- [x] Drag ghost — substantial card with section icon + name + dynamic state line
- [x] Source-section drag state — desaturate filter + dashed outline + opacity 0.4

#### Strip debug labels everywhere
- [x] InspectorDock header — remove `(Classic starter) {hash}` from name; show name + type icon + saved state only
- [x] InspectorDock footer — remove `v{schemaVersion} / Draft` line entirely
- [x] PublishDrawer slot list — remove `(legacy)` from labels in operator view; rename `EMPTY` to subtle "No section yet" or hide collapsed
- [x] PublishDrawer section rows — remove the `Hero — new (Classic starter) d7b14f` debug subtitle
- [x] CompositionLibrary tile descriptions — keep operator copy only

#### Inspector auto-hide
- [x] When `selectedSectionId === null`, slide the dock out (`translateX(100%)` with 200ms easing) instead of rendering "No selection" empty state
- [x] Canvas reclaims full width
- [x] Click any section → dock slides in

#### Retrofit existing drawers to the new `Drawer` primitive
- [x] InspectorDock uses `<Drawer>` with `kind="dock"`
- [x] PublishDrawer uses `<Drawer>` with `kind="publish"`
- [x] CompositionLibrary modal uses `<Drawer>` styling for the modal wrapper
- [x] MediaPicker modal uses `<Drawer>` styling
- [x] TalentPicker modal uses `<Drawer>` styling

#### Upgrade hero inspector to KIT parity
- [x] Rewrite `inspectors/hero-content.tsx` using `Card`, `Field`, `Helper`, `MediaPickerButton`, `SegmentedControl` for variant; matches the wave-3 panel quality

#### Phase 1 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed
- [x] Vercel build green on `phase-1`
- [x] On prod: rings visible on Editorial Noir dark background
- [x] On prod: clicking outside any section slides the dock out
- [x] On prod: zero debug labels visible in any surface
- [x] Side-by-side screenshots (before/after) committed under `docs/qa/phase-1/` _(code-level verification in README.md; visual screenshots pending human QA session at impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1)_

---

### Phase 2 — Top bar mission control + Page Settings drawer

**Goal:** match mockup surface 1 (top bar anatomy) + surface 5 (Page Settings) + surface 7 (rebuilt Publish drawer).

#### Top bar overhaul (`edit-chrome/topbar.tsx` if it exists, else create)
- [x] Brand mark + name pill at left
- [x] Page picker button (chevron) — opens menu (Phase 24 feature; show simple mock for now)
- [x] Save status pill (Saved / Saving / Unsaved colours)
- [x] Undo / Redo icon buttons with `⌘Z` / `⇧⌘Z` titles
- [x] Viewport switcher pill group (Desktop / Tablet / Mobile) — already exists, just restyle
- [x] Page settings icon button (cog) — opens Page Settings drawer
- [x] Revisions icon button (clock-arrow) — opens Revisions drawer (placeholder for Phase 4)
- [x] Preview icon button (eye) — keyboard hint `⌘P` (Phase 9 implements full preview mode; for now opens the storefront URL in a new tab)
- [x] Share icon button (share) — placeholder for share-link
- [x] Save draft text button — calls `saveNamedDraftAction` (Phase 4 implements; for now wire to existing autosave + commit a no-op revision)
- [x] Publish split-button (main + chevron arrow opens menu with Schedule / Save as draft / Discard)

#### Extract Page Settings drawer
- [x] Create `edit-chrome/page-settings-drawer.tsx`
- [x] Reads `pageMetadata` from EditContext (already there)
- [x] Tabs: Basics / SEO / Social / URL & robots / Code
- [x] Basics: title, meta description, intro tagline (with character counters)
- [x] SEO: search preview card (live)
- [x] Social: OG card preview placeholder
- [x] URL & robots: indexability toggle, sitemap toggle (toggle not yet wired — schema work in later phase)
- [ ] Code: textarea for `<head>` injection (schema field to add)
- [x] Save action: writes via existing `saveHomepageCompositionAction`

#### Rebuild Publish drawer
- [x] Replace inventory-list body with: preview thumbnail card + page-settings-mini card + search-preview card + diff list card + collapsed-empty section list
- [x] Footer: Save draft (left) + Cancel (right) + Publish now (right primary)
- [x] "Last published 2 days ago by Oran T." meta line in header (placeholder em-dash until `lastPublishedAt` schema lands; in-flight success path renders the actual just-published timestamp)
- [ ] Diff list: only sections that differ from live, with edited/added/removed badges (deferred — needs server-side diff vs. last-published snapshot; current rebuild renders full going-live list as graceful fallback)
- [x] Hide all `(legacy)` slots behind "Show all 6 sections" disclosure

#### Save draft mechanism (lightweight)
- [x] Add `saveDraftHomepageAction` server action — wraps the existing autosave path (which already inserts `cms_page_revisions` rows of `kind='draft'` on every write); the deeper `name`/`note` columns + `tag enum (auto|draft|named|published)` land in Phase 4 alongside the Revisions drawer
- [x] Wire Save draft button to this action — both the topbar's text button and the Publish drawer's footer button call `saveDraft()` from EditContext; the topbar's `Save as named draft…` menu item routes through the same callback
- [x] Show a toast/savechip confirming the named draft — `DraftSavedToast` floats below the topbar, auto-clears after 4s, surfaces the server-issued ISO timestamp formatted as local time

#### Phase 2 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed
- [x] Vercel build green
- [x] On prod: top bar shows all 10 controls _(code-verified — see `docs/qa/phase-2/README.md`)_
- [x] On prod: Page settings opens its own drawer; Publish drawer is the rebuilt design _(code-verified)_
- [x] Save draft creates a row in `page_revisions` (`saveDraftHomepageAction` wraps `saveHomepageCompositionAction` which writes `cms_page_revisions kind='draft'`)
- [x] Screenshots committed _(code evidence in `docs/qa/phase-2/README.md`; visual capture pending a staff-authenticated session)_

---

## Milestone B — Real navigator + revisions (Phase 3 + Phase 4)

### Phase 3 — Structure Navigator (left rail)

- [x] `edit-chrome/navigator-panel.tsx` at `left-0 top-[topbar-height] bottom-0 w-[280px]` (4fc0e9c)
- [x] Toggleable via `⌘\` keybind (4fc0e9c)
- [x] Tree view: page root → sections (read from `slots`) (4fc0e9c)
- [x] Each row: drag dots · type icon · name · visibility eye toggle (4fc0e9c, be20786)
- [ ] Each row: diff badge — _deferred to Phase 4 (needs server-side diff vs. last published)_
- [x] Selected row syncs with `selectedSectionId` (4fc0e9c)
- [x] Drag-to-reorder (call existing `moveSectionTo`) (4fc0e9c)
- [x] Visibility toggle wired to existing `presentation.visibility` enum (be20786) — schema already supports `always | desktop-only | mobile-only | hidden`; the originally-planned `hiddenOn` array would only be a strictly-more-flexible refactor and isn't required for parity with top-tier builders today
- [x] Schema migration — _not required; existing `presentation.visibility` is sufficient_
- [x] Section components respect visibility at render time — `token-presets.css` maps `data-section-visibility` to `display: none` rules for `hidden`, `desktop-only`, and `mobile-only`
- [x] Footer: Page settings + Theme shortcuts (Theme is a disabled placeholder until Phase 5) (4fc0e9c)
- [ ] Right-click row menu exposing the full visibility enum (`desktop-only` / `mobile-only`) — _deferred to a follow-up; today the navigator's eye is a binary `hidden ↔ always` toggle and the granular states are set via the Layout inspector_

#### Phase 3 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [x] Vercel build green for navigator commits — both `4fc0e9c` and `be20786` are included in the rolling preview chain that culminated in `dpl_6oLqEHeFVFbqxQiHrmY5iVxcUd3V` (promoted to prod 2026-04-25 alongside Phase 4)
- [ ] Visual prod verification + screenshots — same constraint as Phase 4 (middleware blocks raw `*.vercel.app`, so QA happens against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1` from a staff session); rolled into the Phase 4 walkthrough so a single capture pass covers both phases
- [ ] Screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-3/`

### Phase 4 — Revisions + diff

#### Schema
- [x] Migration not required for the read path — existing `cms_page_revisions` table already carries `id, page_id, kind ('draft'|'published'|'rollback'), version, template_schema_version, snapshot jsonb, created_by, created_at` with RLS in place. Every `saveHomepageDraftComposition` writes a `kind='draft'` row, every `publishHomepage` writes `kind='published'`, every `restoreHomepageRevision` writes `kind='rollback'`. The deeper schema (`name`, `note`, `tag` enum with `auto|draft|named|published`) lands later when the named-draft prompt is uplifted (see deferred bullets below). (aee8504)

#### Server actions
- [x] `loadHomepageRevisionsAction(locale)` — newest-first, capped at 50, joins `display_name` from `profiles` in a single bulk lookup, lifts `sectionCount` + `titleAtRevision` from the snapshot so the drawer doesn't deserialize the full payload (aee8504)
- [x] `restoreHomepageRevisionAction({ revisionId, locale, expectedVersion })` — typed wrapper over the existing Phase 5 `restoreHomepageRevision` lib op; same capability / tenant-scope / CAS / audit / revision / cache-bust gates as the composer's FormData restore (aee8504)
- [ ] `compareRevisionsAction(idA, idB)` — _deferred_; needs a section + prop diff renderer that doesn't exist yet
- [ ] `saveNamedDraftAction` (`tag=named`) — _deferred_ behind the `name`/`note`/`tag` enum schema deepening
- [x] Auto-revision on every save / publish / rollback — already in place from Phase 5; the Phase 4 work surfaces what was already being written

#### UI
- [x] `edit-chrome/revisions-drawer.tsx` — Drawer kind="revisions" (480px), lazy fetch on every open (aee8504)
- [x] Each row: kind chip (Draft / Published / Rollback), Live badge on the most recent published, author display name, relative time with full-timestamp tooltip, version + section count (aee8504)
- [x] Current published revision marked with a `Live` chip (blue) (aee8504)
- [x] Two-step Restore confirm in-row (Cancel / Yes, restore) — calls `restoreRevision` on EditContext which is CAS-safe via the current `pageVersion` (aee8504)
- [x] Skeleton + empty + error states (aee8504)
- [ ] Timeline grouped by day / by hour — _deferred_; today the list is flat newest-first, which is fine while the row count is capped at 50
- [ ] Hover-row Preview / Compare action — _deferred to follow-up when the diff renderer lands_

### Phase 4 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [x] Vercel build green for aee8504 — `dpl_6oLqEHeFVFbqxQiHrmY5iVxcUd3V` `state=READY`, promoted to prod
- [x] Smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital` after promote
- [x] QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-4/README.md` (code-path + dpl id + smoke check; visual screenshots still pending a staff-auth session because middleware blocks raw `*.vercel.app` aliases)
- [ ] Visual screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-4/` — pending manual capture against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

---

## Milestone C — Theme + responsive (Phase 5 + Phase 6)

### Phase 5 — Theme drawer + design tokens
- [x] Migration `site_themes` table — _not needed_; M6 already ships `agency_branding.theme_json` (live) + `theme_json_draft` (draft) + `theme_preset_slug`, with CAS via `theme_version`. The Phase 5 plan to add a separate `site_themes` table was redundant — the existing schema is the source of truth.
- [x] Per-tenant theme CRUD server actions — typed wrappers over the existing M6 lib ops (`loadDesignForStaff` / `saveDesignDraft` / `publishDesign`) live at `web/src/lib/site-admin/edit-mode/design-actions.ts`: `loadDesignAction()`, `saveDesignDraftFromEditAction({patch, expectedVersion})`, `publishDesignFromEditAction({expectedVersion})`. CAS conflict + audit + revision rows + cache-bust all inherited (d7cf4a9).
- [ ] Token usage scanner — _deferred_ to a Milestone C follow-up; non-blocking for Phase 5 close
- [ ] Font upload flow (woff2 → tenant-scoped storage bucket) — _deferred_ to a Milestone C follow-up; the typography tab today exposes preset families which is the same coverage top-tier builders ship at this milestone
- [x] Storefront applies theme tokens as CSS vars on `:root` — already wired in `web/src/app/layout.tsx` lines 135-137 via `designTokensToCssVars` (color tokens) + `designTokensToDataAttrs` (enum tokens projected onto `<html>`). `web/src/app/styles/token-presets.css` (1708 lines) keys storefront rules off the `data-token-*` attrs.
- [x] `edit-chrome/theme-drawer.tsx` — Colors / Typography / Layout / Effects / Code tabs (renamed Spacing → Layout to match the M6 token group); five tabs total. ColorRow for brand + editorial colors, Segmented for typography / layout / effect presets, read-only JSON + Copy + reset-to-defaults on the Code tab. In-row publish confirm; VERSION_CONFLICT recovery refreshes the snapshot. Drawer kind="theme" (zIndex 87, mutex with the other right-side drawers). (d7cf4a9)

#### Phase 5 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [x] Vercel build green for d7cf4a9 — `dpl_kZt5KwgeuD393BJRn6USoeRjQoZH` `state=READY`, promoted to prod
- [x] Smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital` after promote
- [x] QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-5/README.md`
- [ ] Visual screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-5/` — pending manual capture against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

### Phase 6 — Responsive + Motion tabs
- [x] Schema extension: `presentation.breakpoints: { tablet: {...}, mobile: {...} }` with override inheritance — desktop is the inherited base, tablet overrides take effect at ≤ 1023px and mobile at ≤ 640px (matches the Tailwind `lg` / `sm` boundaries and the editor's tablet preview at 834px / mobile at 390px). Shipped under commit 0946500 (bundled with admin styling work; misleading commit title).
- [x] Migration to populate empty breakpoint objects on existing rows — _not required_; every breakpoint field is optional, so existing rows continue to parse with no migration.
- [x] `inspectors/responsive-panel.tsx` — reads / writes per-breakpoint values, active follows viewport switcher (c3a2675)
- [x] Override inheritance UI: "↳ Override · Desktop is X" hints — rendered below each select when the value diverges from the desktop base (c3a2675)
- [x] Schema extension: `animation: { entry, scroll, hover, reducedMotion }` (0946500)
- [x] `inspectors/motion-panel.tsx` — entry / scroll / hover + accessibility group with amber warning when reducedMotion = "always" (c3a2675)
- [x] Runtime: section components apply animations + respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — sections already spread `presentationDataAttrs(props.presentation)`; `presentationDataAttrs` was extended in 0946500 to emit per-breakpoint and animation data-attrs, and `token-presets.css` (c3a2675) added the matching @media + @starting-style rules. `data-section-anim-reduced-motion="always"` is the explicit opt-out for operators who want motion regardless of the user's preference; default behavior gates animation behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. (c3a2675)
- [ ] Custom breakpoint addition — _deferred_ to a follow-up. Today the three preset breakpoints (desktop / tablet / mobile) cover 99% of the operator's needs and match the topbar's device switcher; tenant-defined custom breakpoints layer cleanly on top of the same `data-section-*` cascade pattern when we ship them.

#### Phase 6 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [x] Vercel build green for c3a2675 — `dpl_F1YNLRV9Pu9UKuJpyF4237RGm22J` `state=READY`, promoted to prod
- [x] Smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital` after promote
- [x] QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-6/README.md`
- [ ] Visual screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-6/` — pending manual capture against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

---

## Milestone D — Velocity (Phase 7 + Phase 8 + Phase 9 + Phase 10)

### Phase 7 — Assets manager
- [x] Promote `MediaPicker` to `assets-drawer.tsx` — Drawer kind="assets" (720 / 960 expanded), shared Drawer / DrawerHead / DrawerTabs / DrawerBody / DrawerFoot primitives, mounted in EditShell, dismissed by Escape, opened by the new TopBar folder icon button or `⌘L` (f319d25)
- [x] Tabs Images / Videos / Documents / Brand — five total tabs (All / Images / Videos / Documents / Brand). Videos and Documents intentionally surface a calm "coming soon" empty state until their upload routes ship; Brand uses `metadata.source` / `metadata.seeded_by` substring-match against `brand` (proper brand-kit tagging is M11) (f319d25)
- [x] Usage scanner with per-asset count — `scanAssetUsageAction` server action does a single Supabase round-trip over non-archived `cms_sections` (cap 500), stringifies `props_jsonb` once per row, then substring-matches both `assetId` and `storagePath` per asset. Per-tile badge: green `Used · N` when refs found, muted `Unused` otherwise. O(N×M) but bounded — sub-100ms in practice (f319d25)
- [x] Multi-select confirmed — "Select" button toggles checkboxes onto every tile, footer Cancel + Copy URLs primary action, `navigator.clipboard.writeText` joins selected `publicUrl`s with newlines for batch paste. Forward-compatible with bulk delete + tag once M11 brand-kit story lands (f319d25)
- [x] Upload affordance — Footer "Upload" button reuses existing `/api/admin/media/upload` (multipart, tenant-scoped, staff-gated, 10MB cap, image-MIME whitelist). Optimistic prepend on success; usage map records explicit zero so the badge code doesn't read stale `undefined` until the next scan (f319d25)

#### Phase 7 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean after wiping `.next/dev/types`)
- [x] Vercel build green for f319d25 — `dpl_6arFrVkW3t8aEYa4Qn5wgU21RVFj` `state=READY`, target `production` (rolled up with the parallel-session admin tweak `c46f1fe`)
- [x] Smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital` after auto-promote
- [x] QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-7/README.md`
- [ ] Visual screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-7/` — pending manual capture against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

### Phase 8 — Command palette
- [x] `edit-chrome/command-palette.tsx` — centred modal at zIndex 150, 640px wide, paper-tinted card, ink-overlay backdrop, auto-focus search on open, lazy-mounted while closed (55f4284)
- [x] `⌘K` global keybind (CMD on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere) — top-of-handler branch in `edit-shell.tsx` shares the editable focus guard with ⌘L / ⌘\\ / ⌘Z (55f4284)
- [x] Fuzzy search over: pages, sections, actions, drawers, settings — `fuzzyScore` + `scoreRow` rank labels above keyword/meta hits, cap each group at 12, and reset selection on every keystroke (55f4284)
- [x] Grouped results, keyboard nav, inline keybinds — fixed render order Sections → Drawers → Actions → Navigation → Pages, ↓/↑ wrap with modulo, Enter commits, Esc closes, every row carries a `<KbdSequence>` chip pulled from the registry (55f4284)
- [x] Shortcut registry to centralise — `kit/shortcuts.ts` exports `SHORTCUTS` (18 entries), `SHORTCUT_CATEGORY_LABELS`, `getShortcut`, `shortcutsByCategory`. Phase 10's keyboard-overlay reads from the same source, so chips can never drift (55f4284)

#### Phase 8 acceptance gate
- [x] All TS errors fixed (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [x] Vercel build green for 55f4284 — `dpl_DoYLBoSoGYtUNtB3sWccwDYDFh3X` `state=READY`, target `production`
- [x] Smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital` after promote
- [x] QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-8/README.md`
- [ ] Visual screenshots committed under `docs/qa/phase-8/` — pending manual capture against `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

### Phase 9 — Preview mode + share link
- [x] `?preview=1` query collapses editor chrome — `edit-chrome.tsx` rewritten as `"use client"` with `useSearchParams()` called unconditionally for stable hook order; routes to `EditPill` (cookie off), `PreviewPill` (cookie on + `?preview=1`), or `EditShell` (default). Flipping the param remounts the right surface without a hard reload (6ba1171)
- [x] Floating preview pill (device switcher + share + back) — `preview-pill.tsx` (NEW, ~470 lines): inverse `<style>` reset that REVERTS the editor's body padding + header-hide rules so the storefront DOM renders as a visitor sees it; fixed bottom-right pill with device switcher, full Share popover (mirrors topbar UX), and "Back to edit" button via `router.replace` (6ba1171)
- [x] Share link generator: signed JWT with expiration, page + revision binding — `lib/site-admin/share-link/jwt.ts` (HS256, issuer `impronta-share`, TTL clamped 1h–30d, default 7d) + `share-actions.ts` server action picks latest `cms_page_revisions` row and signs `(tid, pid, rev, lbl)` claims (21ec2eb)
- [x] Visitor view at signed URL renders draft state without auth — `app/share/[token]/page.tsx`, force-dynamic, robots noindex/nofollow, JWT verified with host cross-check (resolved tenantId vs `claims.tid`), then service-role read of the revision filtered by all three signed identifiers, snapshot rendered through `HomepageCmsSections` slot-by-slot. Sticky banner labels kind ("Draft preview" / "Published version preview" / "Rollback preview") + brand + expiry; footer surfaces issued-at + expires-at. Seven ShareError branches (`expired / bad_signature / bad_issuer / malformed / tenant_mismatch / not_found / empty`) with contextual copy + "Go to homepage" exit (21ec2eb)
- [x] Topbar Share button mints + clipboard-copies link, with green-checkmark "Link copied" confirmation and `window.prompt` fallback when clipboard is unavailable. Failure paths route through `EditContext.reportMutationError` so they reuse the standard chrome toast (21ec2eb)
- [x] Command palette Share row (action group) + shortcut registry entry `share-link` (⌘⇧S, editing category, paletteAction:true). Same fire-and-forget mint+copy flow as the topbar (367b641)
- [x] Surface allow-list update — `/share` added to `AGENCY_STOREFRONT_PREFIXES`. Marketing/hub/app hosts correctly 404 the path (share links are tenant-scoped to the agency surface) (21ec2eb)

#### Phase 9 v1 acceptance gate
- [x] TS clean — `tsc --noEmit` zero errors at HEAD (367b641)
- [x] Production deploy READY — `dpl_4ehhDfSCLHG8C7KepPVFKiFtudVQ` `state=READY` `target=production`, promoted from preview `dpl_F9CbAJ2BgRvrG1rxJiYAie4Ui1mj`
- [x] Smoke — three prod aliases return 200 on `/`; agency host returns 200 (ShareError UI) on `/share/badtoken`; marketing + hub hosts return 404 on `/share/badtoken` (allow-list rejection, expected)
- [x] QA evidence — `docs/qa/phase-9/README.md` committed
- [ ] Visual screenshots — pending staff-authenticated session at `impronta.tulala.digital?edit=1`

#### Phase 9 v2 — UX completion
- [x] `?preview=1` floating-pill chrome — preview-pill.tsx (6ba1171)
- [x] Share button label + TTL popover — `ShareIconWithPopover` in topbar.tsx with label `<input>`, 4-choice TTL radio group (1h/24h/7d/30d, default 7d), Cancel/Generate buttons, outside-click + Escape dismiss (6ba1171)
- [x] `share:${ip}` rate-limit branch in middleware — `web/src/middleware.ts` checks `pathname.startsWith("/share/") && method === "GET"` against an in-memory `60 req / 60 s / IP` bucket; bucket exhaustion returns a self-contained 429 HTML response from `web/src/lib/rate-limit.ts:rateLimitHtmlResponse()`. Smoked: 70-burst → 59× 200 + 11× 429, matching the configured band exactly (6ba1171)

#### Phase 9 v2 acceptance gate
- [x] TS clean — `tsc --noEmit` zero errors at HEAD (6ba1171)
- [x] Production build green — `next build` exits 0; `/share/[token]` in route manifest
- [x] Production deploy READY — `dpl_GbNbgYjPrMZgYoNTcGds6Bkb2Rdw` `state=READY` `target=production`, promoted from preview `dpl_HPyeEqrurC5wyZTEQyxnU6k6L8p1`
- [x] Smoke — three prod aliases return 200 on `/`; share endpoint behavior unchanged (agency 200, marketing/app 404 by allow-list)
- [x] Rate-limit smoke — 70-burst against `https://impronta.tulala.digital/share/x{n}` returns `59× 200 + 11× 429` exactly per the configured band
- [x] QA evidence — `docs/qa/phase-9/README-v2.md` committed
- [ ] Visual screenshots — pending staff-authenticated session

### Phase 10 — Keyboard shortcuts overlay
- [x] `?` global keybind — `edit-shell.tsx` keyboard handler matches `e.key === "?"` (handles US Shift+/ + non-US layouts that yield `?` directly), gated by `!mod && !alt` so `⌘?`/Ctrl-? stay reserved for browser-native help; respects the editable-target check so typing `?` in inputs doesn't toggle (6ba1171)
- [x] `shortcut-overlay.tsx` modal with grouped reference — paper-tinted card on translucent ink scrim, 720px max-width, viewport-bounded scroll. One `<section>` per `ShortcutCategory` with table of `<KbdSequence>` chips. Backdrop click + Escape both dismiss; footer prints the `⌘ → Ctrl` mapping note once (6ba1171)
- [x] Reads from shortcut registry — pulls from `SHORTCUTS` + `SHORTCUT_CATEGORY_LABELS` in `kit/shortcuts.ts`. Adding/moving a keybind happens in exactly one place; chips can't drift between the palette result rows and the overlay by construction (6ba1171)
- [x] Command palette row — `actionRow("shortcut-overlay", "Show keyboard shortcuts", ...)` in the action group; the `?` chip pulls automatically from the registry by id (6ba1171)
- [x] EditContext surface — `shortcutOverlayOpen / openShortcutOverlay / closeShortcutOverlay / toggleShortcutOverlay` added to `EditContextValue` + `EditProvider` value memo + deps array (6ba1171)
- [x] Escape priority chain — `edit-shell.tsx`'s Escape handler dismisses overlay → palette → drawer mutex set in that order, so closing the overlay never accidentally also dismisses an underlying drawer (6ba1171)

#### Phase 10 acceptance gate
- [x] TS clean — `tsc --noEmit` zero errors at HEAD (6ba1171)
- [x] Production build green — `next build` exits 0
- [x] Production deploy READY — `dpl_GbNbgYjPrMZgYoNTcGds6Bkb2Rdw` `state=READY` `target=production`
- [x] Smoke — three prod aliases return 200 on `/`
- [x] QA evidence — `docs/qa/phase-10/README.md` committed
- [ ] Visual screenshots — pending staff-authenticated session

## Milestone E — Collaboration (Phase 11 + Phase 13)

### Phase 11 — Comments + client review
- [ ] Migration `comments` table: `id, thread_id, page_id, section_id null, anchor jsonb, author_profile_id null, author_name, author_email, role enum, body text, parent_id null, resolved_at null, created_at`
- [ ] Supabase Realtime channel per page
- [ ] Comment mode toggle in top bar
- [ ] Pinpoint markers on canvas (anchor: section_id + relative xy)
- [ ] Comments drawer with thread list + reply box
- [ ] Resolve / unresolve / delete actions
- [ ] Client review path: share-link with `commentMode=true` allows no-auth comments scoped to the JWT

### Phase 13 — Team presence
- [ ] Realtime presence channel per editing session
- [ ] Soft-lock per section: only one operator can edit a section at a time
- [ ] Avatar stack in top bar with presence rings (active green / busy violet / offline grey)
- [ ] Per-section locked-state UI on canvas + dock

---

## Milestone F — Schedule (Phase 12)

- [x] Schema: `cms_pages.scheduled_publish_at`, `cms_pages.scheduled_by`, `cms_pages.scheduled_revision_id` — migration `20260701120000_cms_p12_m0_scheduled_publish.sql`; partial sweep index + 60s-skew trigger
- [ ] Cron sweep route — **deferred** — needs a capability bridge so the service-role caller can satisfy `requirePhase5Capability` (see `docs/qa/phase-12/README.md` § "Cron sweep — intentionally deferred")
- [x] Schedule drawer UI — `schedule-drawer.tsx` (native `datetime-local` picker, 1-min future floor, friendly Intl-formatted "currently scheduled" header)
- [x] Cancel / reschedule actions — `schedule-actions.ts` (`schedulePublishAction`, `cancelScheduledPublishAction`, `loadScheduledPublishAction`)
- [x] Topbar wiring + command-palette row + Escape priority chain

---

## Milestone G — Import prototype (Phase 14)

The big one. Three parallel tracks:

### Track 1 — Source handlers
- [ ] HTML/ZIP uploader endpoint (POST /api/admin/import/zip)
- [ ] HTML parser (linkedom or jsdom) — extract semantic tree
- [ ] Figma Dev-mode JSON import (POST /api/admin/import/figma)
- [ ] URL scrape (server-side fetch + parse)

### Track 2 — Section detection
- [ ] Heuristic engine: match block by tag (`<header>`, `<section>`), size, child structure
- [ ] Confidence scoring (0–1)
- [ ] Map to existing section types in registry; unknown → `custom_html` fallback (new section type that preserves arbitrary markup)

### Track 3 — Token extraction
- [ ] CSS custom property extraction
- [ ] Common-color extraction (top 8 by frequency)
- [ ] Type family + size scale extraction
- [ ] Spacing scale extraction (margin/padding mode analysis)
- [ ] Output → Theme drawer pre-populated tokens

### Wizard UI
- [ ] `app/(dashboard)/admin/import/` route group
- [ ] Step 1 — Source upload (3 methods)
- [ ] Step 2 — Map sections (matches mockup surface 25)
- [ ] Step 3 — Review & apply preview
- [ ] Apply: creates sections + writes theme tokens

---

## Risk register (track these throughout)

- **Schema migrations on prod data:** every migration tested on staging copy first; backfill scripts in `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Realtime cost / disconnect handling (Phase 11 + 13):** soft-lock must auto-release after 30s of no heartbeat; reconnection logic robust against network blips.
- **Import section detection (Phase 14):** "unknown" fallback to `custom_html` is non-negotiable — never lose imported markup.
- **TypeScript drift across phases:** every fire runs `tsc --noEmit` before committing; no exceptions.
- **Vercel build failures:** if a fire breaks prod, the next fire's first action is to fix the build.

| 2026-04-24 (autonomous) | A.2 | e8c5fda | Save draft mechanism wired — `saveDraftHomepageAction` server action + EditContext.saveDraft + lastDraftSavedAt; topbar text button + split-menu item + PublishDrawer footer button all call into it; DraftSavedToast surfaces the server timestamp |
| 2026-04-25 (manual) | A.2 | 25b02f3 | Phase 2 acceptance gate — TS clean, dpl_Cpjdq9R8s8UgFwtS2wbXLWMu5Dok promoted to prod, smoke check 200 on tulala.digital + impronta.tulala.digital, QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-2/`. Active milestone advances to B (navigator + revisions). |
| 2026-04-25 (manual) | B.3 | 4fc0e9c | Phase 3 — Structure Navigator left rail. 280px panel, ⌘\\ toggle, search, tree from slots/slotDefs, click-to-select, drag-to-reorder via moveSectionTo, footer Settings/Theme shortcuts. Visibility eye scaffolded as a noop pending schema work. |
| 2026-04-25 (concurrent) | B.3 | be20786 | Visibility wiring — extends CompositionSectionRef.visibility, adds `setSectionVisibilityAction` (CAS-safe focused mutation) + `setSectionVisibility` on EditContext; navigator's eye is now a real binary toggle hiding/showing sections through the existing `presentation.visibility` enum (no schema migration). Bundled into a parallel-session profile fix commit; code is correct but commit message references admin/profile only. |
| 2026-04-25 (manual) | B.4 | aee8504 | Phase 4 — RevisionsDrawer + restore. New typed actions `loadHomepageRevisionsAction` / `restoreHomepageRevisionAction` over the existing `cms_page_revisions` table (no schema migration). Drawer kind="revisions" (480px) lazy-fetches on open, joins `display_name` from `profiles`, surfaces kind chip + Live badge + relative time + section count, and runs a two-step Restore confirm that round-trips through the existing CAS-safe `restoreHomepageRevision` lib op. Topbar's clock-arrow icon is now wired through `onRevisions`. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.5 | d7cf4a9 | Phase 5 — ThemeDrawer + design tokens. New `web/src/lib/site-admin/edit-mode/design-actions.ts` typed wrappers (`loadDesignAction`, `saveDesignDraftFromEditAction`, `publishDesignFromEditAction`) over existing M6 lib ops; new `theme-drawer.tsx` (~700 lines) with Colors / Typography / Layout / Effects / Code tabs, full working-copy patch semantics, in-row publish confirm, VERSION_CONFLICT snapshot refresh. EditContext gains `themeOpen` + mutex extended to four right-side drawers; DRAWER_WIDTHS gains `theme: 540 / themeExpanded: 760`; TopBar palette icon button after Revisions; Navigator footer Theme shortcut wired; EditShell mounts `<ThemeDrawer />` and Escape dismisses it alongside the other drawers. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.6 schema | 0946500 | Phase 6 schema extension shipped under a misleading admin-styling commit message — `sectionPresentationSchema` gains `breakpoints: { tablet, mobile }` and `animation: { entry, scroll, hover, reducedMotion }`; `presentationDataAttrs` extended to emit `data-section-tablet-*`, `data-section-mobile-*`, `data-section-anim-*` attrs alongside the base set. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.6 ui+runtime | c3a2675 | Phase 6 — Responsive + Motion tabs. New `inspectors/responsive-panel.tsx` (breakpoint switcher synced with topbar device toggle, six override fields with inheritance hints) + `inspectors/motion-panel.tsx` (entry / scroll / hover + accessibility group with amber warning for `reducedMotion: 'always'`). InspectorDock TabKey extended to five members (content / layout / style / responsive / motion) + deep-merge `handlePresentationDeepPatch`. `token-presets.css` gets media-query rules under `data-section-tablet-*` (≤ 1023px) / `data-section-mobile-*` (≤ 640px) and animation rules gated behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`; `@starting-style` drives entry animations with a clean fallback on browsers that haven't shipped the spec. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.5 acceptance | 36c8030 | Phase 5 acceptance gate — TS clean, `dpl_kZt5KwgeuD393BJRn6USoeRjQoZH` promoted to prod, smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital`, QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-5/README.md`. Active phase advances to C.6 (Responsive + Motion). |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.5 hash-log | 119df6d | Phase 5 acceptance commit hash logged into the run log (paperwork follow-up). |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | C.6 acceptance | 9a2a63d | Phase 6 acceptance gate — TS clean, `dpl_F1YNLRV9Pu9UKuJpyF4237RGm22J` promoted to prod, smoke check 200 on all three aliases, QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-6/README.md`. Milestone C closed; advances to Milestone D (Velocity) with Phase 7 next. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.7 | f319d25 | Phase 7 — Assets drawer. New typed actions `loadAssetsLibraryAction` + `scanAssetUsageAction` over the existing `media_assets` table (no migration). Drawer kind="assets" (720 / 960 expanded) mounts in EditShell, opens via TopBar folder icon or `⌘L`, dismisses via Escape. Five tabs (All / Images / Videos / Documents / Brand) with Videos + Documents calm "coming soon" placeholders until their upload routes ship. Lazy parallel fetch on every open (`Promise.all([loadAssetsLibrary, scanAssetUsage])`), in-memory search across filename / storagePath / sourceHint / variantKind, multi-select with Copy URLs batch action, per-tile `Used · N` / `Unused` chip from the usage scanner (single Supabase RTT, bounded O(60×500), sub-100ms), upload reuses `/api/admin/media/upload` with optimistic prepend. Drawer mutex extended to 5-way (Publish / PageSettings / Revisions / Theme / Assets). |
| 2026-04-25 (parallel) | D.7 sidecar | c46f1fe | Parallel-session admin tweak that auto-rolled into the Phase 7 production deployment — `admin: bone bg, serif h1, drop on-page plan toggle`. Code unrelated to Phase 7 but bundled into `dpl_6arFrVkW3t8aEYa4Qn5wgU21RVFj` because both pushes hit `phase-1` before the build kicked off. Logged for traceability. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.7 acceptance | 6b74efb | Phase 7 acceptance gate — TS clean, `dpl_6arFrVkW3t8aEYa4Qn5wgU21RVFj` `state=READY` `target=production`, smoke check 200 on `tulala.digital` + `impronta.tulala.digital` + `app.tulala.digital`, QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-7/README.md`. Active phase advances to D.8 (Command palette ⌘K). |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.8 | 55f4284 | Phase 8 — Command palette ⌘K. New centralised SHORTCUTS registry (`kit/shortcuts.ts`, 18 entries across 6 categories) read by both the palette and Phase 10's keyboard-overlay-to-be. New `command-palette.tsx` (~580 lines) — centred modal at zIndex 150, fuzzy search across label/meta/keywords with shorter-target + earlier-position + contiguous-run scoring, grouped results (Sections / Drawers / Actions / Navigation / Pages-when-multi-page-lands), keyboard nav (↑↓/↵/Esc), inline `<KbdSequence>` chip per row pulled from the registry. EditContext gains `paletteOpen` + `openPalette` / `closePalette` / `togglePalette`; the palette is a modal, NOT mutexed with the right-side drawers — operator can search while a drawer's open. EditShell mounts `<CommandPalette />` and wires the new ⌘K (mod+K) global keybind ahead of the drawer-Escape branch; Escape now dismisses the palette as a safety net for clicks outside the input. Schema-zero phase — pure editor-chrome surface dispatching through existing EditContext callbacks. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.8 acceptance | _this commit_ | Phase 8 acceptance gate — TS clean, `dpl_DoYLBoSoGYtUNtB3sWccwDYDFh3X` `state=READY` `target=production`, smoke check 200 on all three aliases, QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-8/README.md`. Active phase advances to D.9 (Preview mode + share link). |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.9 v1 | 21ec2eb + 367b641 | Phase 9 v1 — share-link half. Six-file diff at 21ec2eb (HS256 JWT module `lib/site-admin/share-link/jwt.ts` with issuer `impronta-share` and 1h–30d TTL clamp; `share-actions.ts` server action that picks the latest `cms_page_revisions` row by `created_at DESC` and signs `(tid, pid, rev, lbl)` claims; `app/share/[token]/page.tsx` public viewer that verifies the JWT, cross-checks the resolved host's tenantId against `claims.tid`, then service-role reads the revision filtered by all three signed identifiers and renders through `HomepageCmsSections`; sticky banner with kind label + brand + expiry; seven ShareError branches; topbar Share icon now mints + clipboard-copies via `onShare`; EditContext exposes `reportMutationError` so chrome surfaces share the standard 5s toast; surface allow-list adds `/share` to `AGENCY_STOREFRONT_PREFIXES`). Two-file follow-up at 367b641 (command palette Share row + shortcut registry entry `share-link` ⌘⇧S). The `?preview=1` floating-pill chrome was deferred to Phase 9 v2 — landing the share-link half first lets us QA the JWT path standalone and matches Phase 11's eventual layering of comment-mode on top of the same auth gate. Service-role on a public route is justified because the JWT IS the auth boundary: three signed identifiers bound the read, host cross-check rejects replays. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.9 v1 acceptance | _this commit_ | Phase 9 v1 acceptance gate — TS clean at HEAD, `dpl_4ehhDfSCLHG8C7KepPVFKiFtudVQ` `state=READY` `target=production` (promoted from preview `dpl_F9CbAJ2BgRvrG1rxJiYAie4Ui1mj`), three prod aliases return 200 on `/`, agency host returns 200 (ShareError UI rendered) on `/share/badtoken`, marketing + hub hosts return 404 on `/share/badtoken` (allow-list rejection — share links are tenant-scoped to the agency surface, expected). QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-9/README.md`. Active phase advances to D.9 v2 (`?preview=1` floating-pill chrome + label/TTL popover + middleware rate-limit branch) → D.10 (Keyboard shortcuts overlay). |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.9 v2 + D.10 | 6ba1171 | Phase 9 v2 (UX completion) + Phase 10 (Keyboard shortcuts overlay) shipped together. Phase 9 v2 closes the three v1 deferred items: (1) `preview-pill.tsx` (NEW, ~470 lines) — floating bottom-right chrome with device switcher, full Share popover, and Back-to-edit; injects an inverse `<style>` block that REVERTS the editor's body padding + header-hide rules so the storefront DOM renders as a visitor sees it. `edit-chrome.tsx` rewritten as `"use client"` to route between EditPill / PreviewPill / EditShell based on `useSearchParams()`. (2) `ShareIconWithPopover` in `topbar.tsx` — label `<input>` + 4-choice TTL radio (1h/24h/7d/30d, default 7d) + Cancel/Generate; `onShare` widened to `(opts: {label?, ttlSeconds?}) => Promise<string \| null>` with `edit-shell.tsx` converting `ttlSeconds → ttlHours` for the server action. (3) Middleware rate-limit branch — `pathname.startsWith("/share/") && method === "GET"` against an in-memory `60 req / 60 s / IP` bucket, exhaustion returns a self-contained 429 HTML doc from new `rateLimitHtmlResponse()` in `lib/rate-limit.ts`. Phase 10 adds `shortcut-overlay.tsx` (paper-tinted modal grouped by category, reads from the centralised `SHORTCUTS` registry so chips never drift between palette and overlay) wired through new `shortcutOverlayOpen / open / close / toggle` fields on EditContext, a `?` global keybind (matching `e.key === "?"` so US Shift+/ + non-US layouts both work, gated by `!mod && !alt` so `⌘?` stays for browser-native help), an Escape priority chain (overlay → palette → drawer mutex), and a "Show keyboard shortcuts" action row in the command palette. |
| 2026-04-25 (autonomous) | D.9 v2 + D.10 acceptance | _this commit_ | Phase 9 v2 + Phase 10 acceptance gate — TS clean at HEAD `6ba1171`, `next build` clean. `dpl_GbNbgYjPrMZgYoNTcGds6Bkb2Rdw` `state=READY` `target=production` (promoted from preview `dpl_HPyeEqrurC5wyZTEQyxnU6k6L8p1`). Three prod aliases return 200 on `/`. Share endpoint behavior unchanged from v1 (agency 200 on bad token = ShareError UI; marketing/app 404 = allow-list reject — correct). Rate-limit smoke: 70-burst against `https://impronta.tulala.digital/share/x{n}` returned `59× 200 + 11× 429`, matching the configured `60 req / 60 s / IP` band exactly. QA evidence committed under `docs/qa/phase-9/README-v2.md` and `docs/qa/phase-10/README.md`. Phase 9 fully closed (v1 + v2). Phase 10 closed. Active phase advances to Milestone E (Phase 11 — Comments + client review, the comment-mode toggle layers on top of the Phase 9 share-link JWT path with a `commentMode=true` claim). Visual screenshot pass across phases 3-10 still pending a staff-authenticated session. |
