# Tulala Drawer Reference

> **Source of truth:** [`_help.tsx`](./_help.tsx) (the `DRAWER_HELP` constant).
> This Markdown file is hand-generated from that registry — when you change
> entries, update both. Future TODO: `npm run gen:drawers-doc` script that
> emits this from `_help.tsx` automatically. The registry shape is also
> consumed by the future `/support/<slug>` pages, the in-app chat Q&A, and
> the ticket-submission category routing.
>
> **For the bigger picture** — audit findings, execution plan, designer
> handoff package — see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) in this directory.
> Drawer rationalization (demote ~30 to popovers, promote ~5 to pages) is
> tracked there as workstream WS-4.

Each entry covers:
- **Who** — the primary audience (drives the eyebrow chip in the in-app help panel)
- **Purpose** — one sentence answering "what is this view for"
- **What you can do here** — concrete actions
- **Related** — drawer ids users typically jump to from here
- **Dev notes** — internal notes, surfaced here only (never in UI)

## Coverage check

This document covers every drawer with a registry entry as of generation. New drawers added to `_state.tsx` (`DrawerId` union) without a corresponding entry in `_help.tsx` will:
- Render the drawer normally
- Skip the ⓘ button (graceful no-op)
- Not appear here

To add help for a new drawer:
1. Add an entry to `DRAWER_HELP` in [`_help.tsx`](./_help.tsx) keyed by the new drawer id
2. Re-run the doc generator (or hand-update this file) so support pages and the chatbot pick it up
3. Verify the ⓘ button appears in the drawer's header
